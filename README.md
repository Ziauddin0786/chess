Introduction 
Welcome to our Chess Game, a web-based implementation of the classic strategy 
game, designed using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and shell scripting. This project aims 
to bring the timeless game of chess to your browser, offering an engaging and 
interactive experience for players of all skill levels. 
Overview of the project 
Our Chess Game leverages the power of JavaScript for dynamic gameplay mechanics 
and user interactions, while CSS ensures a visually appealing and responsive design. 
HTML forms the backbone of the application's structure, providing a clean and 
organized layout. Shell scripting is utilized to streamline the development process, 
automate tasks, and manage dependencies, ensuring a smooth and efficient 
workflow. 
The game's interface features a traditional 8x8 chessboard with intuitive drag-and
drop functionality for moving pieces. Each piece follows the standard rules of chess, 
and the game includes features such as move validation, check detection, and the 
ability to reset the board. Players can enjoy the game against a computer opponent 
or a human player in a local multiplayer setup. 
Game objective 
The objective of our Chess Game is to checkmate the opponent's king, rendering it 
unable to escape capture. Players must strategically manever their pieces, anticipate 
their opponent's moves, and make calculated decisions to outwit and outplay their 
adversary. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the game or a seasoned 
player aiming to sharpen your skills, our Chess Game provides a challenging and 
enjoyable platform to test your strategic thinking and improve your chess prowess.
